* Cythonize more, read recent tutorials:
    * https://www.peterbaumgartner.com/blog/intro-to-just-enough-cython-to-be-useful/
    * https://members.loria.fr/LMendoza/link/Cython_speedup_notes.html
    * chunking should be moved to functions outside of RSCodec python object, so that we can make a cpdef and use memoryviews. Essentially, all looping functions should be done in cythonized functions, outside of Python objects (we can't cythonize Python objects methods).
    * remove all PyObject calls, especially in bytearrays
        * maybe replace all bytearrays by array 'i' and check if no more python calls
        * or maybe try to create an array with nogil, no PyObject call
        * or another way to make a pure C array? Or any kind of chained list? Something to store an array of items? We just need a basic array, nothing fancy, but with no Python call.
        * cpython array is much more efficient than cython view array! https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/CwtU_jYADgM
            * then use nogil in cdef to ensure there is no python object (try with gf_poly_add() ).
        * use vector as a variable https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54759483/how-to-return-two-values-in-cython-cdef-without-gil-nogil
            * great to specify inside ctuples in cdef function definition return value
        * once return type is changed, try to change the exception type, maybe if pointer we set exception to a int instead
    * return types for each functions, especially those returning an array, maybe I can retry returning memoryviews now?
        * especially for rs_encode_msg() and decoding functions (may require a change in return values, to drop the tuples, or use vectors instead to return inside a ctuple)
    * replace all len() with array.shape[0]:
    regex search: len\(([^\)]+)\)
    replace: \1.shape[0]
    * add noexcept to cdef functions definitions once we finished unpythonizing all functions, because it will make debugging harder (exceptions will be printed but not propagated) https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/migrating_to_cy30.html#exception-values-and-noexcept and https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#error-return-values
    * cpdef is slightly faster than cdef + def in classes https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48864631/what-are-the-differences-between-a-cpdef-and-a-cdef-wrapped-in-a-def
    * define return ctype value for each function, otherwise "You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) declare exception values for functions which return Python objects. Remember that a function with no declared return type implicitly returns a Python object. (Exceptions on such functions are implicitly propagated by returning NULL.)".
    * add nogil (and noexcept) to most cpdef functions https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54759483/how-to-return-two-values-in-cython-cdef-without-gil-nogil
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41764244/obtaining-pointer-to-python-memoryview-on-bytes-object
    * Memoryviews:
        * Const memoryview to accept immutable bytes https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#read-only-views
        * Memoryviews do not require the GIL except for copying: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#memoryviews-and-the-gil
        * Memoryviews and Cython Arrays https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#memoryview-objects-and-cython-arrays
        * CPython Array module: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#cpython-array-module
        * to access parent array: a.base https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#memoryview-objects-and-cython-arrays
        * can coerce memoryviews without copying content? Does it work for other types of arrays than numpy arrays? https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#coercion-to-numpy
    * cdivision = False has a 35% speed penalty! But we are reliant on Python division style... We would have to rewrite a LOT of the maths! https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#compiler-directives and https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/enhancements-division
    * with cython.nogil, parallel(): https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/parallelism.html#cython.parallel.parallel
    * Recode the Cython extension into Rust instead ? Like cryptography did? https://lwn.net/Articles/845535/ and https://pythonspeed.com/articles/rust-cython-python-extensions/
        * see also: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-extension-performance/
        * integrate with https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust and meson supports rust too

------

Other TODO apart from Cython:
* Optimize pure python implementation by using _bytearray() instead of [] whenever possible (compare with changes done on the cython implementation)
* Pre-allocate bytearrays whenever possible in the pure-python implementation (like the cython implementation)
* Test and fix issues with galois fields smaller than 2^8.

* Try to reproduce encoding and decoding using an external library, potentially faster and supporting both polynomials and matrices modulo n, such as flint: https://fredrikj.net/python-flint/nmod_poly.html and https://pypi.org/project/flint-py/#description

* move creedsolo to its own repo so that cythonization and c build is not optional and we can use cibuildwheel to build several different wheels for various platforms

* [x] Fix optional cythonization post pep517 and with isolated builds:
    * Main issue is that although pep517 standardizes pure python packages building, extensions building is not standardized at all and mainly locked in setuptools, although a few other tools with their own custom process exist such as hatch, meson, enscons https://hackmd.io/@gaborbernat/py-packaging-summit-2022#Building-C-Extensions-without-Setuptools---Henry-Schreiner-III-and-Ofek-Lev
    * setup.py is not deprecated, only calling it as a cli tool is deprecated: https://discuss.python.org/t/custom-build-steps-moving-bokeh-off-setup-py/16128/11 + see also conditional hooks in hatch https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/config/build/#conditional-execution
    * can't access extras from setup.py, so that's not a solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66083971/setup-py-how-to-find-user-specified-bracketed-extras
    * poetry supports optional cythonization, readily usable examples: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2330
    * the old setup.py and setuptools system is usually ancient on a lot of linux distribs, so we end up with an ancient python ecosystem, pyproject.toml fixes that https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html
    * update conda building process? "Conda 3.22 was just released, adding load_file_data function that can read toml files, so we can template the conda recipe dependencies directly from pyproject.toml . The conda recipe also now just builds from the wheel, which is simpler." https://discuss.python.org/t/custom-build-steps-moving-bokeh-off-setup-py/16128/17 - but beware, conda-build globally sets --no-isolation for pip https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-use-pip-install-to-build-some-scientific-packages-from-sources-with-custom-build-arguments/24717/6
    * --install-option is deprecated: https://discuss.python.org/t/passing-command-line-arguments-to-pip-install-after-install-options-deprecation/22981

* [x] Rollback to v1.7.0 on PyPi and change all releases in v2.x branch as pre-releases.
* [x] Avoid packaging of tests/* folder inside the sdist
    * [x] maybe impossible with single-module layout, may need to switch to src-layout (use __init__ to make reedsolo and creedsolo importable directly with same API, and place creedsolo in its own package)
* [] Overhaul again the build process, maybe change backend to switch to Meson: https://discuss.python.org/t/explicit-optional-cythonization-via-config-setting-post-pep517-and-install-option-deprecation/25379
* [] cibuildwheel github actions only on release
    * [x] set pypi secret for auto upload
    * [x] configure unit testing of builds
    * [x] use test pypi
    * [x] fix RST issues
    * [x] upload new release to test
    * [] add macos and windows oses
    * [] switch to real pypi
* [] make tests against unireedsolomon and pyfilefixity to future proof (max errors, max erasures, max mix, non max scenarios) - but only for one single python version in the continuous integration, otherwise will be too time consuming
    * [] Repackage pyFileFixity to PEP517 with a pyproject.toml so it can be installed in --editable mode with pip. Then just add to ci (not local test).
* [] Optimized maths build for Cython https://github.com/Technologicat/setup-template-cython/blob/master/setup.py
* [] finish array optimizations (see jupyter notebook)

To support bit arrays:
* Surprisingly, there is no bitarray in cython nor standard Python library. We need to use 3rd party modules, but they don't seem to have a cython/C interface, so they are likely slow. Still, it could be nice to support them for those who work on bit arrays.

* alternative using bitshift operators: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53419563/1121352
preallocation: x = 1<<10 # or x = 0 # int in Python 3 or long in Python 2 can be arbitrarily large https://stackoverflow.com/a/43458926/1121352
assigning 1 at bit 19: x = x | 1<<19 # or x |= 1<<19
accessing bit 19: x = x & 1<<19 # or x &= 1<<19
More operators: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43458926/1121352
x &= ~(1<<19) # clear bit 19
x ^= 1<<19 # toggle bit 19
x = ~x # invert *all* bits, all the way to infinity
mask = ((1<<20)-1) # define a 20 bit wide mask
x &= mask # ensure bits 20 and higher are 0
x ^= mask # invert only bits 0 through 19

(x >> 19) & 1 # test bit 19
(x >> 16) & 0xf # get bits 16 through 20.
